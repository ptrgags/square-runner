# Square Runner
Porting my old Flash/Java game from several years ago to HTML5.

## Square Runner (Square Runner Flash)

This was my first attempt at making this game, back in 2010-2011. Wanted to make Flash games, so I tried out Haxe (back then, styled HaXe). Looking back, I'm surprised how sophisticated it was for something early in my programming career.

Haxe changed since I last looked at this code. With a little modification, I was able to get it to compile again!

Even though I didn't plan on it at first, I will continue development on this project, bring the code up to my new standards. Releases 1.x.x will be devoted to the Flash version.

## Square Runner 2 (Square Runner Java)

Later in 2012-2013, I decided to port this project over to Java. Did pretty well at it, made the engine more sophisticated, but never finished it.

I want to combine all the Java sub-projects into one project and set up a build script so it compiles to a JAR again. Then I will add improvements like with Square Runner Flash. I will use versions 2.x.x to denote the Java version.

## Square Runner 3+ (Square Runner Web)

Now it's 2015. I'd like to try my hand at Square Runner again, this time in HTML5 with EaselJS. I probably won't bother with porting the game engine. Back then, I was reinventing the wheel to learn about software design. Now I just want to make the project more modern and use existing libraries to see just how much I've improved as a developer over these years.

The Web version will be Square Runner 3.x.x when I make releases.
